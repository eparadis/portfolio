Prototypes to validate our designs

<!--more-->

## The Details

Two colleagues and myself were considering a startup venture involving user-generated content of multi-path stories. I created a working prototype to validate some of our design ideas.

I also created a prototype exploring an in-place editor concept. Enable editing mode with the button at the top and then click on any text to edit. Changes aren't persisted in this prototype.
