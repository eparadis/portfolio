An assortment of demos

## The Details

Here is a collection of design ideas, usually implemented in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I use these as a way to sketch, explore, and iterate interactive elements.

## Intro Animations

I was considering adding some animation to a site and playing around with the idea of "Engineering & Design" and my first name.

Press the "Engineering" and "Design" buttons to trigger the animation states.

Use the two buttons to control the full-screen wipe.

## Interactive

I was looking to build a design tool for [a specific kind of synthesizer circuit](http://mickeydelp.com/blog/anatomy-of-a-drum-machine?) and thought some interactive linked sliders might be a good input method.

## Generative music

I've been interested in generative music for quite a while. Here is a sketch that generates "songs" using a set of rules.

## FORTH machine

This is pretty nerdy. Here is an implementation of FORTH I wrote that runs in the browser. [FORTH is a programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) that I find very compelling due to its simplicity. If you'd like to try your hand, [the full page view](https://codepen.io/eparadis/full/oNNGwWP) is best.

## Virtual Machine

This is for the real nerds. Here is an entire virtual machine and an assembly language assembler for it. This is pretty gnarly and also [best viewed fullscreen](https://codepen.io/eparadis/full/mdyPXJa). The machine trace is on the left, the assembly editor is on the right, and if your code writes to memory address 999, characters will appear in the output on the far right.
