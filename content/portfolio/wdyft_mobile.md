Mobile App prototype for Peer-To-Peer Marketplace

<!--more-->
As part of my User Centered Design certificate coursework, I designed and built a mobile app low fidelity prototype for users to buy and sell items simply and securely. This design focused on the buyer's user experience.
    Design process: ideation, sketches/low-fidelity prototype, [sanity check usability testing with paper prototype?], mid-fidelity prototype with Marvel [was it marvel?]
    Artifacts: scans of ideation sketches and prototypes, scan of notes from critique, GIF of prototype
