Computer Vision on a Mobile Testbed

<!--more-->

I have been involved in electronics and robotics since before my days in college. I've kept up with the rise of "Maker" culture, going to far as to [start a Makerspace](https://dallasmakerspace.org/) many years ago.

Read about one of my projects from 2013 [here](http://edparadis.com/mobile_opencv/). This little robot still exists, although it has been scavenged for parts. The computer vision techniques I learned for the project are still relevant: many Augmented Reality experiences rely on static fiducials tracked by mobile cameras for position tracking.
