Computer Vision on a Mobile Testbed

<!--more-->

I have been involved in electronics and robotics since before my days in college.

Read about one of [my older projects](http://edparadis.com/mobile_opencv/) as written up in 2013. This little robot still exists, although it has been scavenged for parts. The computer vision techniques I learned for the project are still relevant: many Augmented Reality experiences rely on static fiducials tracked by mobile cameras for position tracking.
