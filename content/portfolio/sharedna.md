Usability Study Design, Execution, and Insights

## The Story
- background
- goal for the project
- type of work
- type of team
- my role
- _3 sentences_

As part of my User Centered Design certificate coursework, my team designed and performed a usability study of a UW Medicine mobile application for sharing genetic test results. The app is designed to simplify and manage the sharing of genetic test results between care providers, patients, and whomever the patients wish to share their test results with. We produced a report with our study's results and insights. I shared the role of study moderator with the other team members.
