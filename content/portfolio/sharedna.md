Usability Study Design, Execution, and Insights

<!--more-->
As part of my User Centered Design certificate coursework, my team designed and performed a usability study of a UW Medicine mobile application for sharing genetic test results. The app is designed to simplify and manage the sharing of genetic test results between care providers, patients, and whomever the patients wish to share their test results with. As part of the project, we produced a report with our study's results and insights about it's use by patients.
