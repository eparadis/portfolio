Desktop website prototype for experienced sellers

<!--more-->
As part of my User Centered Design certificate coursework, I designed and built a low fidelity website prototype. [What was the design goal of this prototype?]

## Design process

- existing convention research
- low fidelity prototype
- quick prototype testing/evaluation
- mid-fidelity prototype with Marvel [again was it marvel? did i use something else alongside it at this point?]

## Artifacts

- scans of sketches
- GIF of prototype
- scan of iteration notes
- GIF of final
