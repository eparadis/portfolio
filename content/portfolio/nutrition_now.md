Mobile App Design and Prototype using the UCD process

<!--more-->

## The Story

As part of my User Centered Design certificate coursework, my team designed and prototyped a mobile application for managing food nutrition. It aimed to streamline the meal recording process and promote healthy meal decisions by reducing the negative emotional association with dieting. Our goal was to encourage a long-term behavior change towards healthier nutrition habits, culminating in the obviating of the app itself. We shared the roles of project management, ideation, and design, with visual design falling mainly on one of the team members with a visual design background.

## UX Design Process

```
+----------+   +-------------+   +--------+   +-----------+
| Ideation +---> User Survey +---> Design +---> Prototype |
+----------+   +-------------+   +---^----+   +-----+-----+
                                     |              |
                                     |        +-----\/---+
                                     +--------+ Evaluate |

## Ideation

The nutrition tracking experience is common among those we surveyed, but adherance was low. We considered both a mobile app and a countertop personal assistant. The ubiquitous presence of cell phones and user's familiarity with nutrition-tracking apps won out.

## User Survey
Our primary question was "Why did users stop tracking their nutrition?"

Survey results:

- Too time-consuming
- Too difficult to use
- Forgetfulness
- Unrewarding
- Met their goal

## Design
We chose design principles to address each of the users' issues.

- Wizard-style dialogs with minimal number of steps clearly prompt user
- Image recognition of food elemenates most data entry
- Non-technical portion measurements simplify data entry
- Meal-time notifications remind users when they normally eat
- Gradual increasing fidelity of portion questions prevents long time commitments when users are first establishing the habit of food tracking
- Avoid "progress bar" indicators because they are demotivating

## Prototype

## Evaluate

Users responded to our prototype with questions about the status of their progress towards their goals. They also were confused by how little data the app was asking them to enter. We also received feedback that the conversational nature of the dialogs was not conveying enough information about status.

<!-- ## Iteration
Did we even iterate this?

## Challenge in Design
- explain the core challenge(s)
- _1-2 sentences and screenshots if helpful_

## Re-evaluation of Design Decisions
- show iteration and process

## Development Adjustment
- who I worked with
- what happened
- _1-2 sentences, bullet points_

## Launch / Results
- what happened, what was the outcome?
- what were the "wins"
- _1-2 sentences, a few bullet points_ -->

## Artifacts

<!-- ## Reflection / Retrospective

As my first formal experience with the UCD process, 

- what went well
- what didn't work
- what I'd change next time
- what I enjoyed
- future actions: tie to business goals if possible -->
