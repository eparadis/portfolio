Mobile App Design and Prototype using the UCD process

<!--more-->

As part of my User Centered Design certificate coursework, my team designed and prototyped a mobile application for managing food nutrition. It aimed to streamline the meal recording process and promote healthy meal decisions by reducing the negative emotional association with dieting. Our goal was to encourage a long-term behavior change towards healthier nutrition habits, culminating in the obviating of the app itself.
    Design process: design hypothesis, survey design, survey, survey result analysis, design iteration, prototype creation, prototype testing, testing report with insights
    Artifacts: scans of sketches, copy of survey, GIF of prototype, link to report
