I'm **Ed Paradis**, a software engineer on the UX Designer path. After working as a developer for over a decade, I realized that the difficult problems are determining what to build, not how to build it. I'd like to find a place that lets me do some of both.

I've always been making things for people to use, and my experience as a developer means writing code and deploying servers will be a tool in my belt for the rest of my life. But after completing a Certificate in User-Centered Design in 2018, I learned how products can be so much more effective by iterating prototypes directly with users.
