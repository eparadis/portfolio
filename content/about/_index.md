Hi, I'm **Ed**.

I do Engineering and Design, but mostly Engineering. After many years in technology, my concern is not “How do I build it.” It’s “What do I build?”

You should hire me because - 

I’m a triple threat - Engineering career, Design education, and Management experience.

I’ve got domain knowledge - behavioral change, healthcare tech, edu-tech, software engineering, hardware prototyping, robotics, non-profits, academia...

You need a cool head - I’ve been through a few startups and I’m not going to freak out with every investor bobble.

I’m here for people, not things - understanding them, getting them to use your product, inspiring them to build the right thing, keeping them motivated, doing right by all stakeholders.
